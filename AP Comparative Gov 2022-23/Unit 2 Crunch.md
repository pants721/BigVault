Notes on [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VntLRkSvmtckz4O66dCV1PiKCbsYwzE/view) study guide (thank you Mr. Sherry!!!)

### Topic 2.1
## Parliamentary, Presidential, and Semi-Presidential Systems

- Parliamentary systems, like the UK, **combine law making and executive functions**
- This allows the national legislature to select and remove the head of government and cabinet
- So this is like in the US when congress impeaches a president

- Presidential systems like Mexico and Nigeria have a cabinet mostly responsible *to* the elected executive
- Their legislatures can only remove cabinet members through impeachment
- These system shave seperate elections popular elections for national legislature and their top executive leader
- The top executive leader serves as both head of state and head of government.
- The national legislators and the top exec leader serve set-terms

- Russia is a semi-presidential system
- Russia has seperate popular elections for the president and the national legislature
- The president can nominate a prime minister but they must be approved by the legislature
- Cabinet members are held accountable by both the president and legislature


### Topic 2.2
## Comparing Parliamentary, Presidential, and Semi-Presidential Systems

- Parliamentary systems have less obstacles to enact policy than presidential systems (presidential systems have divided branch powers)
- Parliamentary systems have their own checks on the executive branch
- Parliaments may 
	- Censure cabinet ministers 
	- Refuse to pass legislation proposed by the executive  
	- Question the exec and cabinet ministers
	- Impose tiime deadlines on calling new elections


### Topic 2.3
## Executive Systems

- Governments have executive institutions that include chief executives and cabinets
- These execs formulate, implement, and enfore policy through different methods and agencies

Titles, power, structure, and functions vary in executive leadership across the six countries:

#### China
- China's president serves as commander in chief, chair of China's Military Commission, and General Secretary of the CCP/NPC
- The president nominates the *premier* of the NPC
- The premier of the NPC serves as head of government, overseeing the civil serives
- Changes in top leadership are accomplished behind closed doors

#### Iran
- Iran's Supreme Leader sets the political agenda, serves as commander in chief, appoints top ministers, the Expediency Coucil, half of the Guardian Coucil, and the head of the judiciary
- The president is elected for up to two 4-year terms
- The president oversees the civil service, and conducts foreign policy

#### Mexico
- Mexico has an elected president
- They serve as both head of state and head of government
- They also serve as commander in chief and leader of the bureaucracy
- They **also** can approve domestic legislation and lead foreign policy
- The president can only serve one term

#### Nigeria

#### THE UK OI OI
- The uk has a monarch (rip lizzy)
- This monarch serves ceremonially as head of state and formally appoints as prime minister the leader of the part or coalition holding the largest number of seats in the house of commons
- They also have a pm (prime minister)
- The pm can call elections, set the foreign policy agenda, and serve as de facto commander in chief and chief executive over the civil service


### Topic 2.4
## Executive Term Limits

Executive term limits have pros and cons with regard to promoting stability and effective policies in a country

Pros:
- Check executive power
- Stop the emergence of dictators and personality rule
- Help to focus the officeholder on governing not winning elections
- Provide opportunities for new leaders with new ideas, policies, or goals
Cons:
- Force good execs to leave office
- Not enough time for an exec to reach goals
- Impede "policy continuity"
- Weaken accountability
- Create a lame-duck (?????) period for the officeholder
- Prevents the officeholder from building experience as chief exec
- Can cause poorly designed policy


### (mini) Topic 2.5
## Removal of Executives

Across the AP Comparative Gov Course Countries (tm), execs can be removed by the legislative branch through diff procedures

Little section for my own research

#### China
- NPC elects the president and also has the power to remove the president by majority vote

#### Iran
- The Supreme Leader has the power to dismiss the elected president
- The SL can do this if the pres has been impeached by parliament, or found guilty of a constitutional violation by the Supreme Court

#### Mexico
- idk tbh

#### Nigeria
- Complicated but possible

#### Russia
- Decision to remove a president is indicted by the State Duma
- Decision to remove a president is voted on by the Federation Council
- Both decisions must be accepted by 2/3 of their chambers (300 and 114 votes respectivley)

#### The UK
- The UK has impeachment for the prime minister
