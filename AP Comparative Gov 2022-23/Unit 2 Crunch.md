Notes on [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-VntLRkSvmtckz4O66dCV1PiKCbsYwzE/view) study guide (thank you Mr. Sherry!!!)

### Topic 2.1
## Parliamentary, Presidential, and Semi-Presidential Systems

- Parliamentary systems, like the UK, **combine law making and executive functions**
- This allows the national legislature to select and remove the head of government and cabinet
- So this is like in the US when congress impeaches a president

- Presidential systems like Mexico and Nigeria have a cabinet mostly responsible *to* the elected executive
- Their legislatures can only remove cabinet members through impeachment
- These system shave seperate elections popular elections for national legislature and their top executive leader
- The top executive leader serves as both head of state and head of government.
- The national legislators and the top exec leader serve set-terms

- Russia is a semi-presidential system
- Russia has seperate popular elections for the president and the national legislature
- The president can nominate a prime minister but they must be approved by the legislature
- Cabinet members are held accountable by both the president and legislature


### Topic 2.2
## Comparing Parliamentary, Presidential, and Semi-Presidential Systems

- Parliamentary systems have less obstacles to enact policy than presidential systems (presidential systems have divided branch powers)
- Parliamentary systems have their own checks on the executive branch
- Parliaments may 
	- Censure cabinet ministers 
	- Refuse to pass legislation proposed by the executive  
	- Question the exec and cabinet ministers
	- Impose tiime deadlines on calling new elections


### Topic 2.3
## Executive Systems

- Governments have executive institutions that include chief executives and cabinets
- These execs formulate, implement, and enfore policy through different methods and agencies

Titles, power, structure, and functions vary in executive leadership across the six countries:

#### China
- China's president serves as commander in chief, chair of China's Military Commission, and General Secretary of the CCP/NPC
- The president nominates the *premier* of the NPC
- The premier of the NPC serves as head of government, overseeing the civil serives
- Changes in top leadership are accomplished behind closed doors

#### Iran
- Iran's Supreme Leader sets the political agenda, serves as commander in chief, appoints top ministers, the Expediency Coucil, half of the Guardian Coucil, and the head of the judiciary
- The president is elected for up to two 4-year terms
- The president oversees the civil service, and conducts foreign policy

#### Mexico
- Mexico has an elected president
- They serve as both head of state and head of government
- They also serve as commander in chief and leader of the bureaucracy
- They **also** can approve domestic legislation and lead foreign policy
- The president can only serve one term

#### Nigeria
- Nigeria has an elected president
- They serve as both head of state and head of government
- They also serve as chief executive, commander in chief, and head of civil service

#### THE UK OI OI
- The uk has a monarch (rip lizzy)
- This monarch serves ceremonially as head of state and formally appoints as prime minister the leader of the part or coalition holding the largest number of seats in the house of commons
- They also have a pm (prime minister)
- The pm can call elections, set the foreign policy agenda, and serve as de facto commander in chief and chief executive over the civil service


### Topic 2.4
## Executive Term Limits

Executive term limits have pros and cons with regard to promoting stability and effective policies in a country

Pros:
- Check executive power
- Stop the emergence of dictators and personality rule
- Help to focus the officeholder on governing not winning elections
- Provide opportunities for new leaders with new ideas, policies, or goals
Cons:
- Force good execs to leave office
- Not enough time for an exec to reach goals
- Impede "policy continuity"
- Weaken accountability
- Create a lame-duck (?????) period for the officeholder
- Prevents the officeholder from building experience as chief exec
- Can cause poorly designed policy


### (mini) Topic 2.5
## Removal of Executives

Across the AP Comparative Gov Course Countries (tm), execs can be removed by the legislative branch through diff procedures

Little section for my own research

#### China
- NPC elects the president and also has the power to remove the president by majority vote

#### Iran
- The Supreme Leader has the power to dismiss the elected president
- The SL can do this if the pres has been impeached by parliament, or found guilty of a constitutional violation by the Supreme Court

#### Mexico
- idk tbh

#### Nigeria
- Complicated but possible

#### Russia
- Decision to remove a president is indicted by the State Duma
- Decision to remove a president is voted on by the Federation Council
- Both decisions must be accepted by 2/3 of their chambers (300 and 114 votes respectivley)

#### The UK
- The UK has impeachment for the prime minister

### Topic 2.6
## Legislative Systems

Oh my god another fucking one of these

| Unicameral | Bicameral |
| ---------- | --------- |
|China|Mexico|
|Iran|Nigeria|
||Russia|
||The UK|


#### China
- Party controlled legislative system
- Unicameral
- Consists of an elected NPC (National People's Congress)
- NPC is recognize as the gov's most powerful institution
- NPC elects the president, approves the premier, and legitimizes policies of the executive

#### Iran
- Iran has a thocracy
- Unicameral
- the Majles is elected; holds the power to approve legislation, oversee the budget, and confirm presidential nominees to the Cabinet
- This body acts under the supervision of the Guardian Council to ensure compatibility with Islam and Sharia Law

#### Mexico
- Congressional-presidential system
- Bicameral
- Consists of an elected lower house: the Chamber of Deputies (badass)
- CoD approves legislation, levies taxes, and verifies outcomes of elections
- Senate is the elected upper house
- The senate holds the unique power to confirm presidential appointments to the Supreme Court, approve treaties, and approve federal intervention in state matter

#### Nigeria
- Congressional-presidential system
- Bicameral
- Consists of elected upper and lower chambers (Senate and House of Representatives)
- Both approve legislation
- The senate has unique impeachment and confirmation powers

#### Russia
- Parliamentary-hybrid system
- Bicameral
- Consists of an elected state Duma
- The Duma passes legislation and confirms the prime minister
- An **appointed** Federation Council approves budget legislation, treaties, judicial nominees, and troop deployment

#### The UK
- Parliamentary system
- Bicameral
- Consists of an elected House of Commons
- HoC approves legislation
- The PM is appointed by the monarch
- An appointed House of Lords review and amends bills from the Commons, delaying implementation as a **power check**


### Topic 2.7
## Independent Legislatures

- Legislative powers can be constrained by other governmental institutions
	Examples include:
	- China's Politburo Standing Committee, the actual center of power in the Chinese state
	- China's Standing Committee of the NPC, which has legislative duties most of the year when the NPC is not in session, sets NPC legis agenda, supervises NPC member elections, and interprets the Constitution and laws
	- Iran's Expediency Council, which is selected by the SL to advise the resolution of disputes between the Majles and the Guardian Council
	- Iran's Guardian Council itself oversees the Majles the make sure laws are tight and good and shit
- Legis's have potential to reinforce legitimacy and stability by responding to public demand, openly debating policy, facilitating compromise between factions, extending civil liberties, and restricting the power of the executive


### Topic 2.8
## Judicial Systems

AGAIN IM GOING TO SCREAM

- Judiciaries have different functions in the course countries
- They use various methods to appoint judges 
- In all, judges interpret and apply laws, as well as resolve disputes
Here we go 

#### China
- Rule by law, not rule of law
- Judicial system is subservient to the decisions of the CCP
- CCP controls most judicial appointments

#### Iran
- Judiciary's major function is to ensure that the legal system is based on religious law
- Judges must be trained in Islamic Sharia law
- Head of the judiciary is appointed by the Supreme Leader and can nominate half of the Guardian Council with the approval of the Majles

#### Mexico
- Currently, Mexican judiciary is in transition
- Supreme Court has the power of judicial review 
- Amendments to the constitution have been made to make the system more independent and effective


#### Mexico part 2 electric boogaloo
- Supreme Court magistrates are nominated by the president and approved by the Senate for 15 year terms

#### Nigeria
- Supreme Court judges are recommended by a judicial council and are appointed by the president with confirmation by the Senate
- Basically, everyone needs to be chill with it

#### Russia
- Judges are nominated by the president and approved by the federation council

#### The UK
- Common law enforces rule of law (dk what this means tbh)
- Major functions of the supreme court:
	- Serving as the final court of appeals
	- Protecting civil and human rights/liberties
	- Ruling on devolution disputes


### Topic 2.9
## Independent Judiciaries

GOD WHY ARE THESE WORDS SO FUCKING LONG
- A judiciary's independence from other branches depends on:
	- How much authority the courts have to overrule exec and legis actions
	- How judicial officials acquire their jobs
	- Length of terms
	- Pro and academic backgrounds that judicial officials are expected to have
	- How judges are removed

- Independent judiciaries (oh my god use shorter works istg im switching to dvorak) can strengthen democracy by maintaining check and balances, protecting rights and liberties, establishing rule of law, and maintaining seperation of power
- So basically keeping things in balance, making sure everyone has rights, and making sure the power is included in that balance

FINALLY DONE THANK THE LORD
